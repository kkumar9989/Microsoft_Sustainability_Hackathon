Problem Statement:

Public spaces like religious shrines, big music concerts, tourist destinations, bridges etc. which are meant for mass gatherings 
or usage sometimes lack a regulatory mechanism to control the number of people utilizing them simultaneously. Unfortunate circumstances 
can cause stampedes in public spaces or breakage of manmade structures due to overload. These kinds of events could have been managed 
to some extent if there was any kind of auto-control mechanism to restrict the number of people entering when it is more than what the 
place or structure can sustain. Also, the mechanism must be a cost-effective and easily maintained solution for its better acceptance.
